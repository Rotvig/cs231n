#Tensorflow Tutorials
This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous Jupyter notebooks which implement or provide a tutorial on a different Deep Learning topic. 
All models are implemented in Tesnorflow.

* **DCGAN** - An implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network.
* **InfoGAN** An implementation of InfoGAN: Interpretable representation learning by information maximizing generative adversarial nets
* **Deep Layer Visualization** - Tutorial on visualizing intermediate layer activation during MNIST classification.
* **Deep Network Comparison** - Implementations of ResNet, HighwayNet, and DenseNet, for CIFAR10 classification.
* **RNN-TF** - Tutorial on implementing basic RNN in tensorflow.
* **t-SNE Tutorial** - Tutorial on using t-SNE to visualize intermediate layer representation during MNIST classification task.
