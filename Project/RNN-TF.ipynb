    "This iPython notebook is designed to serve as a walkthrough for beginners on how to implement a simple recurrent neural network using Python and Tensorflow. The code in this notebook is based on [min-char-rnn](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) by Andrej Karpathy, and the [Tensorflow port](https://gist.github.com/vinhkhuc/7ec5bf797308279dc587) by Vinh Khuc. Credit goes to them for the original work. I have renamed variables and cleaned up code for the purpose of instruction and clarity. \n",

    "We start by importing a text document that we will use to train the recurrent neural network. This can be any body of text, as long as it is plaintext. I recommend [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) as a way to get public domain texts to train on. After importing the text, we then get a list of all the unique characters in the document. For an english document, this will be the alphabet, along with punctuation and linebreaks. We will need to be able to get the index of a given character, and get a given character with an index, and the last two lines here do that."

    "Next we define the architecture of the network itself. To do this, we begin by intitializing the hidden state (hState) to the starting hidden state (hStart). We then create an empty list (y_outAll). This will serve to collect each of the y values choosen by the network. The for-loop allows for the recurrent part of the recurrent neural network. This will repeat for the size of seq_length we defined above. Within the loop we initialize our weights and bias variables. Then we compute the new hidden state from the x input, and also the previous hidden state. It is this additional matrix multiply of the previous hidden state that allows each new pass through the network to use information from the past. Tanh allows us to get non-linearity from the hidden state. Finally we multiply the hidden state by the top-layer weights and add the bias to get an output y, which will be collected in y_outAll. "

    "And thats it! We now have a working, simple recurrent neural network. Of course, this is just the beginning. You may notice that even with a lot of iterations, the network still isn't doing ideally on the sample outputs. This is because most people actually use more complex recurrent neural networks called [LSTMs](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), which work much better in practice. Hopefully though this walkthrough can give an intuition as to how recurrent network work on a basic level. There is a lot that can be done with recurrent networks that goes beyond text generation, and a network like this is just the beginning."
