\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}
This report is the result of a project work performed as part of the reading course Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition presented by Department of Engineering at Aarhus University. The course follows parts of the CS231n course from Stanford University\footnote{\url{http://cs231n.github.io/}}.

Figure \ref{fig:intro} shows a neural network performing some classifications of images, it has not seen before\footnote{\url{http://cs231n.stanford.edu/}}.

The report consist of a project with theory, implementation details, results, discussion and conclusion. Furthermore the report consists of appendices A and B. The appendices contains the exercises and the code, which was coded in the run of the course.

The basis for the project is the github repository TF-Tutorials\footnote{\url{https://github.com/awjuliani/TF-Tutorials}}. This repository contains an implementation of a Regular Deep Neural Network, Deep Residual Network and a Densely Connected Convolutional Network. The networks are trained, tested and compared for rotation invariance. The test set is the Cifar-10\footnote{\url{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html}}.
