\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}
This report is a result of the project work performed as part of the reading course Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition presented by Department of Engineering at Aarhus University. The course follows parts of the CS231n course from Stanford University\footnote{\url{http://cs231n.github.io/}}.

The report consist of a project with theory, implementation details, results, discussion and conclusion. Furthermore the report consist of appendice A and B. The appendices contains the exercises which has been made in the run of the course.
