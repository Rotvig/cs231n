\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}
This report is a result of the project work performed as part of the reading course Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition presented by Department of Engineering at Aarhus University. The course follows parts of the CS231n course from Stanford University\footnote{\url{http://cs231n.github.io/}}.

The next part consist of a mini project \todo{FINISH THIS WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS}
