This chapter describes the theories behind RegularNet, ResNet and DenseNet. Furthermore Feature Invariance is elaborated, as it is used to explore the classification capabilities of RegularNet, ResNet and DenseNet.

A neural network can result in a test accuracy which exceeds all expectations, and it will be released as an approved classification tool. When the model is then introduced to the industry the misclassification rate happened to be too high. This could happen because of a feature invariance in the images used to train the model. Feature invariance testing is a mayor scope of this project, and it can be done it several ways. Feature invariance testing can be done by transforming, scaling, occlusion and rotating images just to name a few, while in this project an investigation of the latter is done. Figure \ref{fig:FeatureInvarianceSummary} shows some of the different features variances an image can have.

When transforming or scaling test images to verify the accuracy, interpolation can fill out the missing information and so the model might score a bit less in probability for a certain category. The chosen category is, most likely, still higher than other categories and so this type of image variance often test well for invariance testing. This is also verified in the article \textit{Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Network} by \citet{Visualizing}, as seen in figure \ref{fig:FeatureInvariancePhotoseries}. In \citet{Visualizing}, they test their model against test images, which have been transformed, scaled and rotated. The rotation of an image rearranges the pixels in another way than simple interpolation can solve. Instead of a sky always being in top of the image, the sky is in the side of the image and so rotation invariance test will give different arrangement of the pixels than the feature maps are used to. The robustness of the model is tested in this project based on the rotation invariance of the model.
