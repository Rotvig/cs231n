\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conc}

Throughout this report the theory of different subjects within deep learning was elaborated on. A project has been developed to compare the rotation invariance of RegularNet, ResNet and DenseNet. The test set used in this project is the CIFAR-10 data set.

Generally DenseNet is the best network for handling rotation invariance, but the difference between the networks are rather small.
