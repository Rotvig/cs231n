\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conc}

Throughout this report the theory of different subjects within deep learning was elaborated on. A project has been developed to compare the rotation invariance of RegularNet, ResNet and DenseNet. The test set used in this project is the CIFAR-10 data set.

Generally DenseNet is the best network for handling rotation invariance, but the difference between the networks are rather small. RegularNet is better than ResNet to classify rotated images, while ResNet is better at classifying images which has not been rotated. DenseNet is the most complex network of the three networks used for this project. The complexity in the DenseNet also makes it the slowest network to train.
\newline

Overall the three networks tested in this project is not very rotation invariant. They have a dramatic drop in classification capabilities not matter what label or network that is used.
